# CDK

In a conversation with a few friends, I found out that *one* "theory" that
*some* fundamentalist, Christian creationists believe is the speed of light is
"decaying" exponentially. Their logic is that the stars in the night sky are
billions of light-years away, but we can still see them—since they believe
that the earth was made ~6000 years ago, rather than change their beliefs
according to evidence, the *speed of light itself* is changing.

Out of disgust, I decided to do some calculations for them. I couldn't find any
information on a physical mechanism—why would anyone try to say the speed of
light is slowing down?—so I assumed an idealized system.

All you need to do to run this is run `$ python cdk.py <year>`, where 
`<year>` is whatever year it is relative to whatever age creationists
deem the earth.

Enjoy!
