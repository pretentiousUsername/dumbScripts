# CDK

In a conversation with a few friends, I found out that *one* theory that
creationists believe is the speed of light "decaying" exponentially---so,
out of disgust, I decided to do some calculations for them.

All you need to do to run this is run `$ python cdk.py <year>`, where 
`<year>` is whatever year it is relative to whatever age creationists
deem the earth.
